Blue Team – Threat Hunters
Focus: Damage Control
The Blue Team is responsible for detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents. As defenders, they monitor systems for suspicious activity, contain threats, and minimize damage during and after an attack.

Purple Team – Cyber Security Managers
Focus: Improvements in Detection and Defense
The Purple Team bridges offensive and defensive efforts by combining insights from both Red and Blue Teams. They focus on enhancing detection mechanisms, refining response strategies, and improving overall security posture through continuous feedback and collaboration.

VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing)

VAPT refers to a two-phase process used to identify and address security vulnerabilities:

Vulnerability Assessment: Automated and manual scanning to detect known weaknesses in systems, networks, or applications.
Penetration Testing: Controlled simulation of real-world attacks to exploit identified vulnerabilities and evaluate potential impact.
Together, these practices help organizations proactively strengthen their defenses.

Types of Hackers

White Hat - Ethical hackers who test systems with permission to improve security.
Black Hat - Malicious actors who exploit systems illegally for personal gain.
Grey Hat - Individuals who may violate laws or ethical standards but do not have malicious intent.

Common Cybersecurity Threats

Phishing
Phishing involves attackers pretending to be trustworthy entities—via email, messaging, or fake websites—to deceive users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, account details, or financial data.
Ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts files or locks entire systems, rendering them unusable until a ransom is paid. Even with payment, data recovery is not guaranteed.
Malware
Short for "malicious software," malware includes viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, adware, and ransomware. It is designed to disrupt operations, steal data, or gain unauthorized access to systems.
Social Engineering
This technique relies on manipulating human behavior to gain access to confidential information. Attackers use psychological tactics such as urgency, fear, or trust to trick individuals into revealing credentials or performing actions that compromise security.
Zero-Day Attack
A zero-day attack exploits a software vulnerability that is unknown to the vendor or developers. Since no patch exists at the time of exploitation, these attacks are highly dangerous and difficult to defend against.
Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
In a MITM attack, an adversary intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties without their knowledge. This often occurs over unsecured networks, such as public Wi-Fi, allowing attackers to capture login credentials, messages, or financial data.
